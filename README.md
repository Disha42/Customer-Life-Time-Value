# Customer-Life-Time-Value
This project has been done as a part of Data Mining course at Carnegie Mellon University under professor Alexandra Chouldechova. 
It is an attrition model to predict whether a customer will cancel their subscription in the next 6 months using Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Models. The accuracy achieved is 82% and sensitivity 85%. In this project we predicted the lifetime value of a customer using cross-validated regularized regression (Lasso), performed K-means clustering with PCA and Hierarchical clustering to segment customers as active or sleeping.
